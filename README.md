# Multi-Stage Amplifiers

* In `RC` Coupling, a capacitor is used as the coupling device. The capacitor connects the output of one stage to the input of the next stage in order to pass the `AC` Signal on while `BLOCKING DC BIAS VOLTAGE`. 
* In `Transformer` Coupling, transformer is used as the coupling device. It performs same actions as RC Coupled amplifier but permits `IMPEDANCE MATCHING`.
* In `Direct Coupling` the individual amplifier stage bias condition are so designed that the two stages may be directly connected without the necessity for `DC ISOLATION`.
